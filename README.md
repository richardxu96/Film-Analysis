## Film-Analysis Readme

### What is this?
The purpose of this project is to gain insight of the film industry, practicing my technical skills along the way.  

### Technical Requirements
- API to access an online database
- Matplotlib and pandas to create graphs
- Might need SQL to organize data

### Graphs
1. Volume of movies per year with line graph
2. Expenses and Revenue to produce movie with population pyramid
3. Length of movies with scatter plot
4. Time of year movies released with bubble chart
5. Location (global and domestic) where movies are shot with heat map
- Look for technological impacts
  - Color, Sound, other camera improvements
  - Medium : VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray, streaming platforms
  
**- Breakdown by ratings: G, PG, PG-13, R with pie graph**

### Relationships between variables
1. Year release x expense/revenue
2. Rating x expense/revenue
3. Length of movie x expense/revenue
4. Expense x Revenue
